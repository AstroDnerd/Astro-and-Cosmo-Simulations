# Work on ILLUSTRIS 3

This contains the work I did on Illustris 3 data under supervision of Dr. Annalisa Pillepich.
The data I used was [Illustris-3 L75n455FP], where I specifically worked with the 135th Snapshot (redshift 0). 

I wrote reports to complete certain exercises in my quest to provide a more comprehensive view of the relation between galaxy stellar mass and halo by analysing the Output 
and Post Processing data of the snapshot at z=0.
