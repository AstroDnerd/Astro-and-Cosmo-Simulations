# Numerical Hydrodynamics at Perimeter Institute

Unoffically took the online course on Numerical Hydrodynamics offered by [Daniel Siegel].

The course covered topics on:
1. Basic Notions of Partial Differential Equations
2. Basic Equations of Computational Fluid Dynamics
3. Finite Difference Methods for PDEs
4. Properties of conservation laws (theoretical background)
5. Riemann problem for the Euler Equations
6. Numerical schemes for conservation laws
7. Approximate Riemann solvers
8. Source terms and higher dimensions
9. Outlook: a primer on discontinuous Galerkin methods

Here contains notes, slides and codes that I wrote on various problems like Exact Riemann Solver for Euler Equations, etc.
